<p>I covered establishing a comprehensive cross-account backup strategy in AWS
Organizations in the previous articles and videos.</p>
<p>However, as an architect, one of the most frequent patterns I come across in
the real world in this space is organisations having an imbalance of backup and
recovery strategies. This is when there is a really detailed backup process
that includes all the production resources in the backup jobs, with encrypted
and replicated copies, but having minimum or even zero effort in testing
recoverability of the backed up data and having playbooks for such scenarios.</p>
<p>Most of the time what happens to cover the checkbox for recovery testing in
security audits and internal process checks is to do a quarterly (or even
scarier, annual) manual recovery check for a single file off the backup vault.
This soon becomes a process for process&rsquo;s sake and loses the real aim of
testing if actual backed up data is recoverable. Furthermore, having an annual
recovery test for an unrelated file does not help in establishing runbooks for
Disaster Recovery (DR) scenarios. It isn&rsquo;t even close to what you would do in
a SHTF situtation. This is missing the entire half of a complete backup
strategy.</p>
<p>So in short, you should</p>
<ol>
<li>frequently test your backed up data</li>
<li>have runbooks for SHTF scenarios, and drill them</li>
</ol>
<p>Without these two conditions, when something goes wrong (notice that I didn&rsquo;t
use <em>if something goes wrong</em>), your engineers are not going to have a proper
idea on how to get back to normal. They will have to figure things out as they
try to manage systems and people when both of these are screaming at their
face. It will be that much harder to stick to your Recovery Time Objectives
(RTO) and you will have no idea about the Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)
because you have no idea how useful the backups are.</p>
<p>This article covers two areas in this subject.</p>
<ol>
<li>how to restore data from backups - should give you a basis to build runbooks</li>
<li>how to do automated restore testing - should give you confidence about your
backup strategy and the ability in DR scenarios</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to use the same setup that I used in my previous article <a href="/blog/2024-08-11_aws-backup-cross-account-backups-in-aws-web-console/">on setting
up the backup strategy with AWS Web Console</a>. I have two accounts
<code>workload_a</code> where the original resources are, and <code>backup</code> where the
cross-account backup vault is.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-09-23_1.png" alt=""></p>
<p><code>workload_a</code> account has the resources that should be backed up, and <code>backup</code> will
be the cross-account backup vault. If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with cross-account
backup concepts, refer to <a href="/blog/2023-02-13_aws-backup-cross-account-backups/">my earlier blog
post</a> and the video on the subject.</p>
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u1ohjqhzTvw?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video"></iframe>
    </div>

<p>There is a DynamoDB table called <code>tracking</code> in the <code>workload_a</code> account. There is also an RDS instance called <code>mydb</code> in the same account.
Both of these resources are encrypted at rest with the same KMS key.</p>
<p>A separate KMS key is used to encrypt the Backup Vault contents.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-08-11_backup6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A similar KMS key is present in the <code>backup</code> account which can be used to
encrypt vaults in that account.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-08-11_backup9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The following architecture is going to be used with this aritcle when restoring
data into the <code>workload_a</code> account.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-08-11_backup4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After the last article, I have a few recovery points in both the in-account
vault and the cross-account vault. In this article, I&rsquo;m going to cover the
following scenarios.</p>
<ol>
<li>Recovering data from an in-account vault</li>
<li>Recovering data from a cross-account vault (when it&rsquo;s really bad)</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to perform these two scenarios for both the DynamoDB table and the
RDS instance because they represent the two kinds of resources that AWS Backup
handles with different ways especially when it comes to encryption.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Restoring a snapshot creates a new resource. Snapshots cannnot be restored
into the same resource (to avoid data loss).</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="in-account-recovery-dynamodb">In-Account Recovery: DynamoDB</h2>
<p>Data can be restored from either the resource backup lists or from the AWS
Backup Console. For DynamoDB for example, the backups made either by AWS Backup
or DynamoDB itself are visible in the &ldquo;Backups&rdquo; tab in the DynamoDB table view
<img src="/blog/img/2024-09-23_2.png" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only the snapshots in the in-account vaults are visible here. No external
vault based snapshots can be directly accessed by this account.</p></blockquote>
<p>The snapshots created by AWS Backup have the <code>arn:aws:backup:&lt;region&gt;</code> prefix
whereas snapshots created by DynamoDB independantly will have the prefix of
<code>arn:aws:dynamodb:&lt;region&gt;</code>.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-09-23_3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To restore a snapshot, select the desired entry and click on &ldquo;Restore&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-09-23_4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In the provided screen, define a name fore the new resource that will be
created with this snapshot, and select the encryption settings for the new
resource. With DynamoDB, since the encryption of snapshots is handled by AWS
Backup itself (more on that in the previous articles), the encryption settings
for the new resource can be different from the original resource.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-09-23_5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Also select the Role that AWS Backup will use for the restore action. This can
be the default Role (advisable since it&rsquo;s just about the permission policy that
is attached to the Role. The default Role has the
<code>AWSBackupServiceRolePolicyForRestores</code> AWS managed policy with it and this is
the most convenient way).</p>
<p>When &ldquo;Restore&rdquo; button is clicked, a Restore Job is created in AWS Backup. This
can be viewed by going into AWS Backup console -&gt; Jobs -&gt; Recovery Jobs tab.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-09-23_6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This job is in the pending state, and will complete with the new resource being
created.</p>
<p>After the job goes into &ldquo;Completed&rdquo; state, a new DynamoDB table with the data
from the snapshot can be seen.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-09-23_9.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-09-23_10.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="in-account-recovery-rds">In-Account Recovery: RDS</h2>
<p>For RDS, let&rsquo;s use the AWS Backup console based method where you&rsquo;ll see the
snapshots created by AWS Backup listed in the vault contents.</p>
<p>Go to the AWS Backup Web Console -&gt; Vaults -&gt; Select Vault -&gt; Scroll down to
Recovery Points section.</p>
<p>Since the vault is the destination for snapshots from multiple types of
resources, the snapshots for the specific RDS instance will have to be filtered
in the UI.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-09-23_7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Select the desired snapshot and select Actions -&gt; Restore.</p>
<p>Like DynamoDB, the snapshot gets restored to a new RDS instance. New instance
details can be changed in the restore screen, however unlike DynamoDB, the
encryption configuration doesn&rsquo;t offer a lot of flexibility. The same KMS key
needs to be used for the new instance, because RDS handles encryption outside
of AWS Backup during backup and restore.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-09-23_8.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Clicking &ldquo;Restore&rdquo; creates a Restore Job in the Jobs console, which can be
monitored for successful resource restoration.</p>
<p>Same as the DynamoDB table Restore Job, when this Restore Job goes into
completed state, a new RDS instance can be seen in the list.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-09-23_11.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="cross-account-recovery">Cross-Account Recovery</h2>
<p>Like I mentioned in the last article on this series, to recover from a
snapshot, it has to be in the same account vault as the target account.
Snapshots in a cross-account vault cannot be used to restore resources.</p>
<p>So, in case the source account vaults have been deleted somehow or the
snapshots are needed to spawn new instances in a different account, they have
to copied to the new account vaults first. For this, we can utilise the same
type of job that was used during the cross-account backup job, called Copy
Jobs.</p>
<p>Something that needs to be repeated from the last article is that for this copy
job to successfully happen, the target vault (what I called the <em>source vault</em> in
the last article, yeah, it&rsquo;s a bit confusing) needs to have the proper vault
policy.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If this detail is unclear, please refer to my last post on this, where I
explain what a vault policy does and how this allows cross account copying of
snapshots.</p>
<p>To copy a snapshot to a vault in another account, go to the central account vault (in my case, it&rsquo;s in the <code>backup</code>
account), select the desired recovery point, and click Actions -&gt; Copy.</p>
<p>The resulting screen provides a few options, including a useful option to copy
the snapshot back to the source account vault. This can be used in a disaster
recovery scenario (if the source account isn&rsquo;t fully compromised of course).
However, the snapshot can be copied to a completely different account as well.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-09-23_12.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Like in the previous step, define the IAM role to be used for the copy job.</p>
<p>A Copy Job will be created and once this is completed, the snapshot will be
available in the destination account vault (previously known as source account
vault) to be used for restor jobs.</p>
<p>In the target vault, the snapshots that were copied over can be filtered by the
Source Account field. Only the snapshots that were copied over from a different
account has this field attached to them.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-09-23_13.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The snapshot details will also have a section called Copy Summary, if it was a
result of a copy job.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-09-23_14.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This snapshot can then be used to restore data to a new resource by following
the same steps as above.</p>
<h2 id="continuous-restore-testing">Continuous Restore Testing</h2>
<p>The above workflows cover data recovery that is done manually, usually when
there&rsquo;s a real world need to do so.</p>
<p>However, there is the additional need to make sure that backup data is valid
and restorable when needed. This assurance should be automated and periodical,
and should raise alarms when it fails.</p>
<p>AWS Backup offers a feature called Restore Testing which covers all of these
requirements. Before this feature was introduced, automated restore testing had
to be done manually by writing custom lambda functions. With the new feature, a
restore test plan can be written just like a backup plan is, and can be
scheduled to repeat and notify tests to be run on the restored data. These
automated tests can generate reports that can be both used as useful indication
of the backup strategy and provided as evidence of effective implementation of
a DR strategy during information security audits.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s create a Restore Testing plan for the DynamoDB snapshots that are taken
by AWS Backup.</p>
<p>In the AWS Backup console, go to Restore Testing and click on Create Restore
Testing Plan.</p>
<p>Provide a name for the test plan and define the schedule for the tests to be
run.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-09-23_15.png" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p>AWS recommends that restore testing is done on a non-prod separate account so
that you wouldn&rsquo;t overwhelm limits and quotas and affect production workloads
unintentionally. For this demo, I&rsquo;m going to use the same account, as this is
a productionising detail.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also select the vault and how the snapshots should be selected for restore
testing. It can be either a random selection from a time frame, or the latest
snapshot within that time.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-09-23_16.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In the next screen, assign resources to be tested (or more specifically,
resources of which the snapshots will be tested), just like resources were
assigned during the creation of the backup plan.</p>
<p>Additionally, specify the retention period for the resources created by the
restore testing plan. They are usually immediately deleted, but it can be
configured to retain them for a small time window to do manual testing and
other inspections if needed.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-09-23_17.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Once the Restore Testing plan is created, you can monitor the status of the
test runs by checking the Restore Testing Jobs section in the same page. You
can also view the Restore Job status by going to the Jobs view -&gt; Restore Jobs
tab and then filtering by &ldquo;Restore Type == Test&rdquo;. Normal restore jobs have
&ldquo;Restore&rdquo; as the value for this field.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-09-23_18.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In the job details, there&rsquo;s a field that shows the validation status of the
restore test. This is a basic validation test of the resources that are being
created as part of the restore test. If more &ldquo;manual&rdquo; in detail tests need to
be done, they could be triggered <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/eventbridge.html#restore-job-state-change-completed">based on the restore job status event in
CloudWatch
EventBridge</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-09-23_19.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you configured retention of the restore testing resources, you could see the
DynamoDB table that was created by the restore testing job in the web console.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-09-23_20.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can build CloudWatch alarms to notify you if a certain threshold is broken
for the number of failed restore jobs. This could be vastly useful than waiting
for the yearly manual test to complete which doesn&rsquo;t even test the actual
snapshots (I&rsquo;ve been part of the process that provided evidence like this
during ISO27001 recertifications, and I&rsquo;m not proud of it).</p>

<p>If you saw my <a href="/blog/2023-06-04_information-security-compliance-in-aws-solutions/">article on Information Security Compliance on AWS Solutions</a>
(or my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YE9Iz4iUs84">twitch talk on the AWS From the Field channel</a>)
(or my <a href="https://awsug.nz/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Chamila-de-Alwis-Reducing-your-Compliance-workload-on-AWS.pdf">AWS Community Day NZ 2023 talk on the same
subject</a>)
you know that I like approaching compliance on the three-lines model of
managing -&gt; overseeing -&gt; providing assurance. I also believe the last step of
providing assurance is massively under-scrutinised by the scale of the cloud
and lack of familiarity of the cloud environments by the information security
auditors. AWS services like Audit Manager can be a huge relief in cloud
information security compliance audits by their ability to provide auditor
friendly reports on all parts of your cloud footprint.</p>
<p>AWS Backup Audit Manager is a similar, supplementary, feature that can be used
to generate reports that can provide a comprehensive picture of the status of
the backup and recovery implementation.</p>
<p>Backup Audit Manager can generate different types of reports for backup and
restore activities or more compliance oriented reports if the overall status
needs to be communicated. This helps you achieve both overseeing capability on
top of the ability to provide up to date accurate evidence of your compliance
status.</p>

<li>Write runbooks on how to restore from your backups and regulary run drills
for those runbooks (and improve them if gaps are found)</li>
<li>Automate the testing of backups, ideally using features like AWS Backup
Restore Testing</li>
<li>Use features like AWS Backups Audit Manager to achieve overseeing capability
of risk mitigation status for DR scenarios and to be able to provide
accurate up to date evidence of your work on achieving compliance</li>
