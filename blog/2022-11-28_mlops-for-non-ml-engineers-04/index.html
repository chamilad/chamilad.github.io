</blockquote>
<p>Differences between Software Development projects and Machine
Learning projects were discussed in the previous articles. Let&rsquo;s look at ML Engineering
responsibilities and other unique aspects involved in a Machine Learning
project.</p>
<h2 id="roles-in-a-machine-learning-project">Roles in a Machine Learning Project</h2>
<p>In a multi-disciplinary team, Data Scientists and ML Engineers will have
separate responsibilities to contribute to.</p>
<p>Data Scientists, as the people with knowledge and experience on working with
data, can focus on the Machine Learning part of the process. They have a deep
understanding of the type of solutions to follow, and a working knowledge on the
Machine Learning offering of the platform they are working on. They will decide
the data management, experiment, and training details of the Model and
contribute to designing the deployment pipeline.</p>
<p>ML Engineers, as engineers of other disciplines are called, are better equipped
to handle the DevOps side of the process. They are experienced in software
development, CI/CD, Cloud, and operations. They would also have an understanding of
the Machine Learning lingo and platform administration knowledge and experience
of the platform the team is working on. They will decide operational aspects of
the platform, compute resource management, library, pipeline, and tools development,
and adapting standard software development best practices into the process.</p>
<p>One interesting pattern I have seen is engineers who are Data Scientists by
training, having to work in the DevOps and software engineering space that
has to be filled in the team, where the team is almost fully composed of Data
Scientists. This could be by choice or as a result of the demand from the team.
While this is a good thing for the engineer (while switching disciplines
is hard, it can be a great learning tool, and I have utmost respect for people who do it anyway), the project might
be losing precious Data Science competency trying to do all of it &ldquo;in house&rdquo;.
You can&rsquo;t expect an engineer to watch a Youtube video and implement good
DevOps (and no, Kubernetes does not &ldquo;solve&rdquo; DevOps). The project team should
have a mix of Data Science and ML Engineering competencies for optimal work.</p>
<h2 id="machine-learning-platforms">Machine Learning Platforms</h2>
<p>Machine Learning having specific hardware requirements to do serious work is a
limiting factor for adopting bare-metal platforms for
development. In addition to this, most Cloud platforms that offer a Machine
Learning Platform offer good integration with related services such as
distributed and durable storage, elastic compute, and data analytics and ETL
services.</p>
<p>Amazon SageMaker, GCP Vertex, and Azure ML Workspaces provide Data Science
oriented developer and deployment services that are directly integrated with
the other services. They differ in their approaches to data and deployment
management, and there are feature gaps between the providers depending on their
feature roadmaps. However, all of them provide a Notebook interface, flexible
Notebook compute, Dataset management, (limited) Feature Stores, Model
Registries, and Experiment management. However, role separation between Data
Science and platform administration work can be a bit blurred, especially when
all three providers have Machine Learning Specialty qualifications that focus on
platform administration as well. This could be a bit confusing to anyone without
Cloud practice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the time of writing this article, some features that I wanted to automate
in Azure ML Platform, when writing a set of template Notebooks for the Data
Scientists, were not available in the APIs for tools like Terraform to use.
This could also be something to consider (albeit a somewhat smaller detail)
when you&rsquo;re first evaluating platforms to base your solution on.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Amazon SageMaker tries to separate the rest of the AWS services from Machine
Learning services by separating out basic functionalities needed by a Data
Science role from the DevOps functionalities. SageMaker has been introducing
new features recently to optimise deployment costs and streamline Notebook version
controlling. SageMaker also offers SageMaker studio that integrates the
previously discussed features to offer an easy experience to train and deploy
Machine Learning Models.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Amazon SageMaker also offers good debugging, tracing, and visualisation
capabilities during model training for better visibility into the process. This
minimises the guess work to be done during training and provides better insight
into (ex:) which parts of the Neural Network are effectively active during
training.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A different part of the industry is the multi-persona Platform as a Service
providers. These include providers like Databricks, Dataiku, and Cloudera where
different roles, fulfilled by different engineers, can work on the same
platform with limited overlap between them required. These platforms provide integration
support for most public Cloud storage services, and have varying degrees of
vendor lock-in to suit your taste. They will require specialised training to
get the maximum benefit out of the platform.</p>
<p>Another option is to deploy a mix of Open Source solutions on the Cloud
platform of your choice, only utilising the basic services such as compute,
storage, naming, networking, and routing. Tools like Apache Airflow, KubeFlow
and MLFlow could be useful, however I have not worked with these in conjunction enough to
provide an opinion.</p>
<p>Aspects like Auto scaling and resource management are still part of the process.
Model deployment tends to drift towards Container based services or serverless
offerings on public Cloud platforms. Custom images may need to be built for
training and deployment processes. These are not so different from a software
development project.</p>
<h2 id="devops-vs-mlops">DevOps vs MLOps?</h2>
<p>Most engineers who are new to Machine Learning and are interested in the
operational side of things try to make meaning out of concepts they already
know. This is why they would probably start searching for the phrase <em>&ldquo;devops vs
mlops&rdquo;</em>. Most results for this term ends up being generic articles that mention
something along the lines of <em>&ldquo;devops is about development, and mlops is about
machine learning&rdquo;</em>. In my opinion this is a simplistic reduction of the two concepts.</p>
<p>DevOps is not only about pipelines or pre-commit configs. It&rsquo;s about an
organisation wide culture that emphasises on developer-operations
collaboration. Contrary to popular definitions, using Terraform doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;make
you devops&rdquo;, unless you drive (in most cases) a paradigm shift in the way
different teams work together for common business goals in development, unless
you consider failure as normal and aim for optimal error rates, unless your
culture is oriented towards accepting risk than avoiding it, unless there&rsquo;s close
communication between the development teams and the operations teams on
incident response, unless your product and service managers have stopped asking
for &ldquo;five nines availability&rdquo; for products that have no business being that
much available. Implementing DevOps in an organisation is sometimes a business
process impacting change involving CoEs, consultations, and changing reporting
lines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s common for organisations to pick their existing operations engineers
together to one team and call them DevOps or SRE, without a single top-down
change management process to increase collaboration or to champion DevOps
practices. Even worse, some would have separate teams named <em>SRE</em> and <em>DevOps</em> in
the same company on the same product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, MLOps is a specific pipeline implementation that aims to
increase the Model development, training, and deployment cadence with project
or team specific tools. These tools involve Model Registries, Feature and
DataSet stores, Notebook servers and development compute resources, pipelines
with special hardware attached runners, and specific monitoring set up to
trigger Continuous training and reporting for the Data Scientists. It&rsquo;s rarely
about non-technical processes, and has no impact on organisational culture
(except may be for the way data is collected and treated from different sources
like sales funnels and CRM solutions).</p>
<p>The
impact of implementing MLOps is local to your data engineering and data science
teams, and needs no additional top-down support than what the ML project is
already receiving. It&rsquo;s no different than chosing to use Terraform based
automation for environment management instead of ClickOps for software
development projects. Other than the initial business decision to commit to a
platform service provider, there is no major business level decision to make.
In most platforms mentioned above, MLOps has nothing extra to implement other
than sticking to the vendor provided best practices and features. Organisations
need more support and time for deliberation on actually deciding on investing on
AI/ML projects than deciding which MLOps implementation to use.</p>
<p>It sounds like I&rsquo;m reiterating the same point, but I have seen again and again
how people at all levels of the industry misconstrue the meaning of DevOps down
to CI/CD pipelines and comparing MLOps vs DevOps as two pipeline
implementations. At the risk of sounding a bit too pedantic about the topic, I
should emphasise the apples vs oranges nature of such comparisons.</p>
<h2 id="project-management">Project Management</h2>
<p>Unlike software development iterations which
can be fairly short (two-week Sprints are common in software development
projects), Machine Learning iterations can take a long time, especially in the<br>
Experimentation phase. One problem we had to tackle in the project I took part
in was the difference in cadence the software development tasks had when
compared to the Machine Learning tasks in the same Sprint.</p>
<p>Phases like Experimentation could take a long time to complete with no significant
&ldquo;update&rdquo; to be provided back to project management other than &ldquo;that experiment
was a failure&rdquo;. For project managers who might not be familiar with the way
Machine Learning experimentation works, this could sound like no progress is
being made with the same task being in the &ldquo;In Progress&rdquo; column for weeks, and
sometimes months, while actual progress is being made that just does not have
significant updates to be reported. It is important to understand this fact to
accommodate every engineer in the team and to understand the project
progression.</p>
<h2 id="licensing">Licensing</h2>
<p>Copyright management in Software Development is a complex topic itself. You
have the age old copyright vs copyleft discussion (although more permissive
and business friendly open source licensing, like Apache V2 and MIT, seems to
have won the day for the moment, even with source open trend that companies like
MongoDB started) in the front and center, with some companies backing Open
Source communities with funds and technical contributions as a means of
product development.</p>
<p>Although the same could be applied to the source code that trains the Model in
Machine Learning, licensing the Model itself could be a tricky case. Binaries
or package distributions out of software development projects can be relatively easily
licensed with the source licensing, upstream licensing, and business goals in
mind.</p>
<p>For Machine Learning Models, this could become a bit complex when it comes to
considering the ownership of the data, the algorithm, and the library code used
for various steps between data collection and Model training. Additionally,
given how powerful some Models can become, there will be restrictions in place
enforced by states on the potential users of the license. We have already seen
restriction of hardware sales for specialised GPUs used for Model training
introduced by the USA-China tech race, however I&rsquo;m sure we will soon be seeing
deep discussions on which parts of a Model and its training can truly be Open
Source and which parts will be proprietary while adhering to community oriented
movements like Open Source and Free Software. Of course, this doesn&rsquo;t involve
the API based proprietary model that most AI companies seem to follow at the
moment.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There are various other details that stands Machine Learning projects out from
rest of the software engineering practices. However these can be apparent when
you get to a certain level of detail. Furthermore, some areas like data
engineering, big data storage optimisation, are not ones I can comfortably
discuss without significant experience.</p>
