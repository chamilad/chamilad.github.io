<h2 id="offsite-backups">Offsite Backups</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk theory for a bit.</p>
<p>Data protection in a give solution depends on how thoughtful the backup
strategy is. While a simple Backup Plan in AWS Backup that periodically takes a
backup of the database into the Account-local Vault could technically be
considered as a backup strategy, it is not a good one. For an effective and
resilient data protection policy, backups should exist in locations other than
the solution deployment, with access to them separated by network and access
levels.</p>
<p>Offsite backups make sure that in an event that makes the primary site
unavailable, a secondary site is ready to provide snapshots of the data to kick
off another deployment. This is essential to implement the Recovery Time (RTO) and
Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) of a solution, with properly scheduled and <strong>available</strong>
backups being the key ingredient in implementing for RPO and RTO.</p>
<p>Additionally, offsite backups provide a barrier in a security event that might
potentially take out on-site backups. An actor that has compromised the primary
site will easily be able to control the primary backups as well. An offsite
vault that has different access requirements and is not directly connected to
the primary site through networking will be significantly harder to compromise.</p>
<p>Furthermore, based on the critical nature of the business data, potential for
disruption, and the impact of disruption, government compliance directives
could force solutions to include offsite backups in the Disaster Recovery and
Business Continuity Plans. For example, <a href="https://www.nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document/">New Zealand Information Security Manual
(NZISM)</a> contains processes for
offsite backups as part of the <strong>6.4.6 Backup Strategy</strong> section, which is
further elaborated on by the <a href="https://github.com/craigar-amazon/nzism-aws-ig/blob/main/nzism-awsig.v0.1.md#64-business-continuity-and-disaster-recovery">AWS Implementation Guide for
NZISM</a>.
Systems, where possible should always implement offsite backups for an
effective DR strategy.</p>
<p>Traditional wisdom on backing up data has been on the lines of <strong>3-2-1</strong> where
three copies of the production data needs to be maintained in two different
mediums with one being offsite. This is a minimal standard that can be added on
to with each solution&rsquo;s requirements and as platform technologies progress on
backup and storage features.</p>
<h3 id="offsite-backups-with-aws-cross-account-vaults">Offsite Backups with AWS Cross-Account Vaults</h3>
<p>In AWS, implementing offsite backups is made easy with Accounts, IAM
permissions, and AWS Backup working together. A different account, removed from
the primary deployment in both network level and IAM access level, can be used
as the DR site. It can (and where possible should) be using a different AWS
region selected with data sovereignty requirements of the solution in mind.</p>
<p>AWS Backup Plans provide a simple method of copying each recovery point across to
different Vaults. By using a Vault in a separate Account as the target for the
copy operation, offsite backups can be easily implemented.</p>
<p>Using a different Account brings a few features and advantages to the table.</p>
<h4 id="separation-of-responsibilities">Separation of Responsibilities</h4>
<p>While a Backup Vault can be created in a different region in the same Account,
managing this will not be easy for several reasons. Data persistence will be
spread out in different Accounts in a given deployment. Managing multiple
Vaults in different regions in each Account and making sure they don&rsquo;t drift
from the intended backup strategy will not be an easy task.
Infrastructure-As-Code is as good as the person who codes the said
infrastructure. Even with code-reviews in place, it does not take more than a
single wrong commit to break the backup process without anyone easily
noticing. Managing offsite backups in a separate Account brings this together
to a single pane of glass view.</p>
<p>Additionally, giving access for auditors, operations teams, and management users
to view, verify, and manage backup implementation can be messy with the same
account offiste backup Vault approach. Each Account&rsquo;s Role for these user types
have to be meticulously defined and maintained. Managing access to a single
Account which is guaranteed to be removed from the active compute and data
stores is far easier and brings down the complexity by several degrees.</p>
<h4 id="security-barrier">Security Barrier</h4>
<p>Vault Policies can be used to define which Accounts can use a given Vault as
the offsite, and which Accounts can be used to restore the snapshots. This is
an effective way to separate users who need to perform backups and restore but not necessarily
need access to the actual data while doing so.
Additionally, IAM permissions and Roles can separate security auditors from the
operations users, and provide granular access to reporting without having to
give access to data.</p>
<p>Furthermore, SCPs can be leveraged to make sure the Backup Vaults are not
deleted by accident or on purpose.</p>
<h4 id="cloud-native-3-2-1">Cloud-native 3-2-1</h4>
<p>Going back to the 3-2-1 approach in traditional data protection strategies, AWS
Backup helps easily implement a modified <strong>[2..*]-1-[1..*]</strong> approach for AWS services.
That is, two or more copies of the production data can be available on a single
medium with one or more of them being offsite. Implementing this strategy comes
with minimal cost with usage based costs being applied as the other AWS
services. At the moment, AWS Backup does not offer maintaining available
recovery points in multiple mediums. Recovery Point retention and lifecycle policies allow
transitioning older recovery points to low cost cold storage, however that would not
count as two different mediums with available backups.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While cross-account backups can be part of the Disaster Recovery strategy for
an AWS deployment, unless Backup/Restore is decided as the DR strategy with the
hours or days of recovery time and recovery points that come with it, taking
cross-account backups needs to be supplemented with a fallback deployment for
it to be considered a Disaster Recovery strategy. This
can be a pilot light deployment in the secondary region, refreshed with each
recovery point, or a passive (yet ready to be hydrated) database restored from the
latest recovery point.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="encryption-in-backups">Encryption in Backups</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, AWS Backup Vaults are encrypted with AWS KMS keys. The AWS
managed <code>aws/backup</code> key will be useful for simple use cases, however for
some AWS Services to be properly backed up, the target Vaults must to be
encrypted with CMKs that need to have their Key Policies modified to enable
encrypt and decrypt by Service-linked Role for Backup that performs the
snapshot and copy operations. Furthermore, Cross-Account backup operations need
the destination Account Vault to be encrypted with a CMK.</p>
<p>The reason for this is clear once how different services support AWS Backup is
understood. AWS Services can be categorised into two groups on their level of
support for AWS Backup encryption, as those that support independent
encryption by AWS Backup, and those that do not.</p>
<h3 id="aws-backup-independant-encryption">AWS Backup Independant Encryption</h3>
<p>This is when AWS Backup as a service itself handles encryption of the recovery
points and the cross-account copies of the recovery points. Backup and the
resource association roles take care of encryption so that manual work to allow
key access is minimal.</p>
<p>DynamoDB is a service that supports independant encryption (when <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/advanced-ddb-backup.html">DynamoDB Advanced
Backup</a>
is enabled, which is the case for newer Accounts). When a service supports
independent AWS Backup encryption, the Backup operation for the specific
resource itself uses the Backup Vault key to encrypt the recovery point. This
would be the case even for resources that do not encrypt their content (highly
discouraged, but a possible scenario). Therefore, for these services, the
source Vault (the Vault that performs the first Backup operation), the
destination Vault (the Vault that the recovery point is copied across to), and
the resource itself can be encrypted with AWS managed KMS keys. AWS Backup
handles the backup and copy operation internally and the Key policies do not
have to be modified.</p>
<h3 id="resource-based-backup-encryption">Resource Based Backup Encryption</h3>
<p>For services like RDS that do not support independent encryption, AWS Backup
uses the resource specific KMS key to encrypt the recovery point in the first
place. This happens when the backup is being taken, and the key is used by the
Backup job role (the role we used when [creating Resource Associations above]
(#resource-associations)) that performs the operation. The CMK associated with
the resource should modify its key policy so that the Backup Job
role is able to perform <code>Decrypt</code> (to decrypt the resource data) and <code>Encrypt</code>
(to encrypt the recovery point) operations. Additionally, for
the cross-account copy operation, the destination account has to be given access to the
key as well, since it is the destination account&rsquo;s Backup Service-Linked role
that performs the copy operation.</p>
<p>The following shows the Key Policy statements for a CMK used to encrypt a
DynamoDB table in the source account.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>yyyyyyyyyyyy</code> - source account number,
<code>xxxxxxxxxxxx</code> - destination account number</p>

be setup according to the above model.</p>
<h2 id="restore-testing">Restore Testing</h2>
<p>No backup strategy is complete without restore testing. Talk to any engineer
worth their salt and they will tell you horror stories about how their
meticulous on schedule backups failed miserably when they actually needed do a
restore because the backup format was wrong, backup medium was bad, or the
vendor pushed recovery data format issues to the future. These are so common
that for ISO27001 itself checks for evidence for periodic restore testing. With
traditional vendors and self hosted solutions, restore testing could be a
limited recovery of a subset of files/objects with an email confirmation from
the vendor, which in a real situation could sometimes fail fantastically.
Adding to that is the manual work overhead and room for error in performing the
tests.</p>
<p>In AWS Backup, restoring from a recovery point creates a new resource, to avoid
overwriting existing data. This can be easily adapted into an automated restore
testing plan which provides confidence in the backup strategy and auditable
evidence of properly done restore testing at the same time.</p>
<p>Performing a restore action and testing the validity and integrity of the
restored data can be automated as a periodic (or triggered on each backup job
completion) Lambda function. Resulting CloudWatch logs can be retained for the
period of time reviewers and auditors might be interested in. CloudWatch Alarms
that go off when restore or validation jobs fail can be configured to trigger
p2/p3 incidents with high severity (since failure of a backup can be critical
for business goals).</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As a centralised service for solution wide backup strategy implementation, AWS
Backup provides various constructs to build an automated backup and restore
plan with minimal human intervention needed in the process. Encryption of the
backups is a first-class concept with least-privilege permissions being
leveraged to make sure data is protected at all layers. Disaster Recovery can
be extended on the backup strategy by using automated cross-account backups
that can use different regions to align Business Continuity goals to the
technical implementation. APIs provided by Backup allow for low-intervention
restore testing to be added into the mix for a complete backup/restore
strategy.</p>
