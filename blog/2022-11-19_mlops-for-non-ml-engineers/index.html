<p>Last year I had an opportunity to work with a team of Data Scientists on
developing an Enterprise AI/ML practice. As someone who had not interacted at
development level with Machine Learning and AI before, I jumped on the chance
to learn something new and find a challenge on a new area. The following are a
couple of notes (more to myself) of key points I learnt as an engineer with only
software development and DevOps experience.</p>
<p>The aim of these articles is to give an introduction to Machine Learning
practices and MLOps from a software development and Cloud point of view. Most
concepts I mention here would not go too deep into the topics. If you are a DevOps
engineer who is looking to play the ML Engineer role in a team, the pointers
in these articles could help you. On the other hand if you&rsquo;re looking to learn
Machine Learning and looking for a starter, this is not it.</p>
<p>I also should note that some of the methodologies and practices I mention
related to Data Science may not be the way you might be practicing at your team.
The more I worked with the Data Scientists, the more I could establish a common
vocabulary for concepts that both of us would refer to. These terms could be a
bit different from your usage as well. I&rsquo;m a software developer and will
probably never be a data scientist.</p>
<p>When I refer to <strong>&ldquo;software development&rdquo;</strong> in these articles, I&rsquo;m referring to
the other types of software development and operational aspects of the projects
and products that do not have Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning
components to them. While I&rsquo;m being a little pedantic here, I don&rsquo;t like the
phrase &ldquo;<em>traditional</em> software engineering&rdquo; that similar articles use. Software
Engineering is the umbrella term for all types of such practices and Machine
Learning projects in the industry are part of Software Engineering as a
practice.</p>
<p>Putting everything into a single article quickly became a bad idea, so I have
split this into a series of smaller ones. I will be updating this post in the
future with all the links at the top for easy access.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Edit down the line:</em> I tried to keep the series provider-agnostic, but halfway
through it, I could see that at least some concrete real-world examples of
features have to be explained. In the above mentioned project I worked with
GCP Vertex and Azure ML Studio, however I&rsquo;ve used Amazon SageMaker as the
reference provider since AWS is what I work with the most these days. My work
also involves AWS a lot, so remember to filter the bias.</p>

<h2 id="ml-and-learning-the-basics">ML and Learning the Basics</h2>
<p>When you&rsquo;re working in a multi-disciplinary team, the key quality to build first
is a common language for communication. This would take priority over even the
functional goals of the team since you need to be able to work efficiently
together towards a common goal. As a non-ML engineer, this was the first
challenge in my job.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing most readers would have an understanding of what Machine Learning
is. For me other than a Data Mining module I did in the university, I had no
clear idea what ML was in the current landscape. It&rsquo;s practically impossible to
avoid coming across the phrases &ldquo;<strong>AI</strong>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<strong>Model</strong>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<strong>Deep Learning</strong>&rdquo; on a
daily basis unless you live under a rock these days (Edge AI and IPv6 could fix
that), but a decade old memory on working through a KNN example isn&rsquo;t the
greatest qualification for working on ML.</p>
<p>I dedicated at least a month of extra work on building an understanding of what
AI and ML is, and the &ldquo;language&rdquo; the Data Scientists use. I followed the age-old
&ldquo;try building a model at first, fail and go back to learning&rdquo; method to
the letter. After writing Python code to build a simple binary classification
model (I didn&rsquo;t know this at the time) and not understanding why each line
of code was doing what it did, I stepped down to learning basic ML. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKxRvEZd3Mw&amp;list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIuiBfYad6rFYQU_jL2ryal">The Google
Machine Learning Youtube
Playlist</a>
was helpful here to get a good start. It&rsquo;s old so there could be a few
API changes in the libraries that you&rsquo;ll be using, but nothing a simple web
search can&rsquo;t fix.</p>
<p>You could also start with the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGwO_UgTS7I&amp;list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU">Standford CS229 ML Course on
Youtube</a>
but I do not recommend getting bogged down in details at these early
stages. However, once you have some experience working with ML, revisiting
this is recommended. Andrew Ng is a giant in this space and brings a lot of
knowledge and light into the learning.</p>
<p>I also found that I needed to learn
basic statistics and mathematics needed for ML. A few playlists in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/joshstarmer/playlists">StatQuest
Youtube channel</a> helped a lot
in this case. The author has also <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BLM4TLPY">published a book on the topic</a>
which can be helpful to any beginner.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-machine-learning-different">How is Machine Learning Different?</h2>
<p>Why does Machine Learning need a different perspective compared to software
development? Because Machine Learning as a practice has the following key
differences from other software development practices.</p>
<h3 id="end-product">End Product</h3>
<p>In software development solutions, the end product is a binary or a
collection of binaries and associated artefacts. These are typically produced
as a result of a build pipeline that compiles the source code and any
supporting artefacts together and produces consistent results for a given
version of the source code. By design, these artefacts for a given version
should be reproducible. The released binary or package has a clear progression
of features and bug-fixes in the release timeline.</p>
<p>In Machine Learning, the build result is a <strong>Model</strong>, which is a sweet spot in
the problem&rsquo;s solution space. This point is hard to
reproduce in multiple builds of the same version of the source code. This is
mostly because source code is just one part of the build process in Machine
Learning. A build, or a <strong>Model training</strong> in Machine Learning, is using a data
set that <strong>potentially</strong> contains a pattern (or called a <strong>hypothesis</strong>), and
source code that determines how to traverse the data set to find this pattern
which can be used to generate <strong>predictions</strong> on related but never before seen
data sets, or as called later <strong>real world data</strong>. While the source code and the
data set can be the same for a given two training runs, the pattern the
algorithm ends up with could be different.</p>

<p>Imagine you have at your table a physical model of one of those topographic maps
of a mountainous terrain. You&rsquo;d have mountain tops, valleys, and one or two
trenches. You are tasked to find the lowest point (<strong>minima</strong>) in the map by
only making <strong>finite small incremental steps of touches with your eyes closed</strong>.
Each round starts with a clean state with you having to forget what you learnt
from the earlier round (somehow, I don&rsquo;t know, let&rsquo;s say hypnosis is involved).
In this case, you would find low points in the map just by touching, but
multiple rounds would probably result in you deciding different valleys or
trenches being the lowest point (you can&rsquo;t undo your steps), which are not the
actual lowest point (<strong>local minima</strong>, not the <strong>true minima</strong>). You might even
find the actual lowest point at one round as well. You can change factors like
the distance each step would travel (the distance between two touch points), or
the finite number of steps for each round.</p>
<p>Think of training a Model as trying to find the <em>&ldquo;lowest&rdquo;</em> point in the
solution space by a machine which has no vision, no memory between
the rounds (training jobs), and no way to determine if it has actually reached
the real lowest point. Each &ldquo;round&rdquo; or training job could end up on an
good solution spot, but it might not be the optimal point, and you might not
end up on the same spot twice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a Data Scientist, you might go &ldquo;well, that&rsquo;s not the entire picture&rdquo;
at this point. That is true, but I&rsquo;m using this description for two reasons.
It&rsquo;s better to keep concepts simple for the learning experience. Most
engineers who are not Data Scientists will be able to contribute without
having an understanding of the other definitions and use cases (most of the
time). You might also go &ldquo;that&rsquo;s wrong!&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t know better.
For an introduction I think this is good enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="understanding-data">Understanding Data</h3>
<p>Observations made on a given problem and its possible solutions has a high
importance in all software development. In fact, in software
development understanding the problem and possible ways of solving is key to
writing good software and doing it efficiently. However, other than structured
test data, data points of the problem wouldn&rsquo;t normally play a key role in
actual software development.</p>
<p>In Machine Learning, data is the problem. Solving it involves figuring out the &ldquo;class&rdquo; of the
problem, and figuring out possible approaches to solving it. To do this,
understanding the data set involved and the potential data set the Model will
have to work with is critical.</p>
<p>To do this, the input data should be cleaned and only the important data should
be focused on. Most of the time, Machine Learning works on Data Lakes with
unorganised dumps of data, collected hoping future Machine Learning and Data
Engineering work would be able to use them. This data should be cleaned up,
normalised, and made into formats that Machine Learning understands and can work
with. To do this effectively, a good understanding of the problem is important,
since &ldquo;cleaning up&rdquo; data can mean different things with different problems that
can be solved with the same data set.</p>
<p>Data is worked on as columns rather than rows, which is important when working
with big data for analytical purposes. Efficient columnar storage, retrieval,
and querying is probably solved at this stage of the solution. Each column that
might be of interest to the problem is known as a <strong>Feature</strong>. Getting the
right set of Features as input to a problem solving algorithm is important as
well. Too little, and your solution is plain wrong as it fails to capture the
whole picture. Too much, and you might be wasting precious time and compute
power on details that don&rsquo;t really matter. This is known as the <strong>Curse
of Dimensionality</strong> since trying to find a pattern in a multi-dimensional problem
space becomes increasingly difficult as the number of dimensions increase.</p>
<p>It is critical that this phase is done right. The entire solution could be
influenced by decisions made in this phase, or as the practitioners say
<em>&ldquo;garbage in, garbage out&rdquo;</em>. For an example cleaning up data in a way that rows
with absent values for certain columns are dropped, could introduce a clear
bias in the resulting Model. Likewise, selecting wrong Features, or Features
with superficial patterns that don&rsquo;t really contribute to the solution could
waste resources and lose support for the entire project. <strong>Feature
Engineering</strong> is a sub topic that works on best practices for identifying,
selecting, and deriving new Features.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amazon SageMaker helps in this aspect by making it possible to perform feature
discovery and engineering in the Notebooks (we&rsquo;ll be discussing what Notebooks
are later) themselves with integrated library
functions. The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-sagemaker-notebooks-now-support-git-integration-for-increased-persistence-collaboration-and-reproducibility/">well-documented Git
integration</a>
also allows packaging data
transformation and loading logic as separate reusable functions so that
different data sets and even different teams can reuse what has already been
proven to work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The scale of data that has to be processed is also something to point out. With
the massive volume of data involved in Machine Learning, efficient data storage
and retrieval are problems of their own. Different data management platforms
have been offered to tackle enterprise data management such as <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/workloads/data-warehouse/">Snowflake Data
Warehousing</a>
and <a href="https://docs.databricks.com/delta/index.html">DataBricks Delta Lake</a> that
focus on data storage optimisation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amazon SageMaker takes a step further with it&rsquo;s
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/using-streaming-ingestion-with-amazon-sagemaker-feature-store-to-make-ml-backed-decisions-in-near-real-time/">Streaming</a>
functionality to make the data available as quickly as possible without having
to copy an entire data set across to the compute instance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This part of the process is commonly known as <strong>Exploratory Data Analysis
(EDA)</strong>.</p>
