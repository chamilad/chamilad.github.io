<p>Secure thinking begins before the first line of code is written. It&rsquo;s that
simple, you don&rsquo;t need to have developers in the room to develop a secure
architecture (although having experienced developers invoved in this step can

</ol>
<p>These are obviously deeper topics of their own to go into, but the details can
vary based on business requirements of an actual product. In a general sense,
each of these &ldquo;features&rdquo; can be applied to any stack, in any cloud provider.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this subtopic, I&rsquo;m only talking about the application architecture. There are
lot more things to talk about when it comes to the actual cloud presence
itself, I&rsquo;m covering those below.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Architect (Cloud/Software/Solution) should be able to enforce these high
level requirements along the rest of the product development lifecycle.
Architecture and design isn&rsquo;t a task that gets involved only at the first
steps, it&rsquo;s a technical leadership and guidance role that keeps product
development within technical scope, business requirements,
security, cost effectiveness, scalability, and other such non-functional
requirements.</p>
<p>In smaller operations, there&rsquo;s probably not going to be dedicated
architects, usually more experienced and senior engineers performing this role
and then switching hats into implementation. I&rsquo;d argue it&rsquo;s even easier to
enforce standards and guidelines in this setup, because the target area of
impact is much smaller than an enterprise setup. The best thing about
guidelines and principles is that you can apply them even if all roles,
architects, developers, devops, support, sales, and product management, are
just one person. You don&rsquo;t need to be an established shop to implement least
privilege principle in systems and cloud architecture.</p>
<p>So when the first line of code is written, there should already be an
idea about the security requirements of a product.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about a fully rendered software design with UML and pure
object oriented classes figured out.</p>
<p>The fact that secrets management is done in Secrets Manager, the fact that the database would not be
directly accessible from a dev laptop, and the fact that the S3 bucket will
need authentication and even VPN access in some cases would be known by the
time software development starts.</p>
<p>I know that smaller products do not get built in this perfect clean manner,
where you don&rsquo;t focus on architecture in a detached manner. Most smaller products
get iterated, starting from crappy code and sometimes ending with crappy code,
I know this fact. But this doesn&rsquo;t mean that security boundaries cannot be
setup at an early stage. Most web applications just need a boilerplate Cloud
Security Model to start with. As long as you have the Cloud Security principles
in mind, you can always tweak the finer details.</p>
<p>So, developers should not be expecting to access the storage bucket directly
without authorisation from the frontend. They should not be expecting to
directly connect to the database from their laptops. They should have a clear
idea about the RBAC approach the application will be taking, and they should
not be expecting <code>AdministratorAccess</code> to production AWS Accounts.</p>
<p>There are other application architectural considerations like TLS but I feel
this has been talked about more than enough times. If you&rsquo;re on plaintext in
2025, switch trades. You&rsquo;re not very good at this.</p>
<p>More established work that can be done at this stage are,</p>
<ol>
<li>starting a risk register - more than cloud or software architecture, this
should be done by any software product based business, focusing around the
possible risks the business can face because of software product security
issues. For an example, an accidental data leak should be marked as a high
impact risk, and should have enough mitigations to make the residual risk
small enough to be accepted. This would make governance of security
principles easier. It also makes it easier to track the core reasons as to
WHY certain principles are being applied, so that when those mitigations do
get questioned later, the correact reasoning can be provided (ex: when a new
product manager tries to make a storage bucket public, you can point him to
the risk register and show that doing so would expose the business to a
massive risk)</li>
<li>developer documentation - I put this one in the &ldquo;good to have&rdquo; category
because not all product development cycles can focus on maintaining
documentation. However, clear and to the point documentation outlining key
security principles and guidelines can help a lot, especially when decisions
need to be supported by architecture practice.</li>
<li>architectural sign-off - This is not really applicable to smaller
operations, and especially not during initial product development. If your
scale allows it, and if the slowness of the process is manageable, subsequent
feature changes can be reviewed by architecture practice (person, role, etc)
for vetting. Be warned though, this can easily go out of control, to the
point where introducing even the slightest feature flag change could take
months of architecture board meetings in large scale operations. So don&rsquo;t go
crazy with this thinking.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>Writing secure code isn&rsquo;t really easy, it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;just start thinking secure
code&rdquo;. It takes mostly experience to write intuitively secure code. However,
some level of tooling, enforced policies, and senior engineers being involved
can help here.</p>
<p>There are various language specific tooling available that does static security
scans of the code to mark code that might not be secure. Yes, there could be a
certain percentage of false positives, however linters providing tips during
development time is the best place to catch security issues (&ldquo;shift left&rdquo; and
all that).</p>
<p>Most web application backend code bases will need to be tightly coupled with
the Cloud provider APIs they are hosted on. This is because most web applications do not have
the business requirment of being cloud agnostic, so there&rsquo;s rarely a need to
have an abstraction layer like Kubernetes. It&rsquo;s most likely that the code would know
which service it is hosted on (ex: Lambda function specific optimisations etc).
So it can be somewhat easier to write secure code with specific knowledge of
the cloud platform in mind.</p>
<p>For an example, instead of injecting secrets through environment variables, the
code that runs on Lambda functions or ECS can directly read the secret off of
Secrets Manager or Parameter Store. Doing so helps reduce the possibility of
exposing sensitive configuration even if a certain role or a permission set
gets compromised. If you&rsquo;re writing a cloud-native web application, it makes
sense to go all-in than engineer for some far-in-the-future requirement to
change cloud providers (or even &ldquo;move out of the cloud&rdquo;, whatever that means for
a small bootstrapped web application).</p>
<p>When invoking other AWS services, embedding long-lived AWS IAM credentials
in the code was the most common security mistake made at some point. There
should be enough friction against scenarios like this to reduce the likelihood
of this happening. This means, least privilege developer access to AWS, static
scan tools as pre-commit hooks, in build pipelines etc for secret scanning,
alerts based on (ex:) CloudTrail if access tokens are created, using AWS IAM
Identity Center short term credentials, and just in general, good software
engineering practices like code reviews could help avoiding this common mistake
easily.</p>
<p>An obvious measure is to enforce code reviews, however they can be a bit
unreliable as a sole gate against insecure code. Depending on the scale of the
development team, you can easily run out of people and time to do code reviews,
and complacency can play a huge role in letting insecure code. I&rsquo;ve done this
myself in the past, approved code that was not good enough, just because I
didn&rsquo;t have enough time to properly read the code. This is why code reviews
shouldn&rsquo;t be the only measure against insecure code.</p>
<p>You can build on this to do basic automated vulnerability testing with basic toolsets
that&rsquo;ll pinpoint any obvious gaps or vulnerabilities your application.
Better yet, you can pay a team of pen-testers to get this done in a
waterproof way. Of course, if your app demands extremely sensitive data from
users like ID cards, sexual preferences, you MUST do this independent security review.
There&rsquo;s no way you would survive a compromise otherwise, legally speaking.</p>
<h2 id="supply-chain">Supply Chain</h2>
<p>A special focus should be made on supply chain security, especially these days
where Gen-AI supported coding is everywhere. There&rsquo;s a lot of code that gets
generated too quickly, so manual checking of libraries and their
bug/security fix history is not realistic.</p>
<p>There are a lot of examples of compromised upstream dependencies resulting in
critical security incidents in software products. Especially in web applications where
JS/React frontends and Python backends is the norm, there could be a huge list
of dependencies to check, and doing this manually is not realistic at any
scale.</p>
<p>Fortunately this can be easily automated. You can easily generate an SBOM for a
given commit/package and then have it scanned for known vulnerabilities. Like
before, this is a separate topic on itself, so I&rsquo;m not going to go in to
details here.</p>
<p>AWS does have static and dynamic vulnerability scanning for
Lambda functions, Container images, and other software artefacts in
Amazon Inspector where you&rsquo;d also be able to generate and scan SBOMs. There are
various third party tools that can be used here as well. You can incorporate
these in the CI pipelines (and CD pipelines to gatekeep artefacts failing
quality from being deployed) to make sure you can do this in a scalable (and
also repeatable) manner.</p>
<p>In short, securing (or to be precise, validating) your upstream software supply
chain is almost a fully solved problem. What&rsquo;s not solved is people not using
the tools and solutions available because of various excuses.</p>
<h2 id="packaging">Packaging</h2>
<p>Closely related to this is static vulnerability scanning and software
attestations.</p>
<p>For every code package generated, especially for backend services, (JAR/TAR
file, binary executable;, Lambda layer, or Container image), static security scanning
can be enabled either with AWS specific services or third party tools and
services. This would make sure that you&rsquo;re rolling out fairly trusted code and
configuration at a given point. There are loads of free tools to use for this,
but as a service, Amazon Inspector can be used to scan for vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>This would be fairly infrequent for typical web applications, because even
backend code would rarely get published as libraries. However, you can still
sign and publish software attestations if an additional layer of security and
integrity is needed. This is somewhat unlikely in typical cloud-native web
applications, however there could be scenarios where you would need to verify
the integrity of the software artefacts you deploy in production. For an
example, Lambda Code Signing in AWS can provide this capability where only
signed trusted code would be deployed in Lambda. You can always aim for SLSA
compliance as well, since most managed CI/CD services are SLSA L3 compliant.</p>
<h2 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Cloud footprint security is a large topic. Taking AWS as the concrete
implementation, we can talk about Landing Zone patterns, CloudTrail and
Security Hub integration, Config based alerts and all those details. However
for a small scale web application, these would be a bit of an overkill. You
should probably start with a smaller scale landing zone in AWS with a basic
Account structure to keep things separate and use features such as
cross-account backup vaults, but the cost of the landing zone itself can go up
pretty quickly if this isn&rsquo;t done carefully.</p>
<p>At a minimum, you should have a best practice separation between different AWS
accounts. You should separate dev, test, and production deployments using
different AWS accounts. You should use Service Control Policies and Resource
Control Policies to setup boundaries on those accounts. Like mentioned before,
you should have separate roles for developers, devops, and admins, and you
should be using AWS IAM Identity Center to its full potential.</p>
<p>AWS IAM policies and other related features are basically your friend. Use
permission boundaries to make sure you&rsquo;ve setup the maximum permission levels
for different roles and personas. Use IAM Access Analyser to practice and
improve Least Privilege access. And you can do all of this through code.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing click-ops in 2025, this is probably not going to be the article
that changes your mind. But in case you&rsquo;re ready to change your mind, hear me out.</p>
<p>Write your infrastructure down. Yes, it&rsquo;s going to be hard at first, when you
want to experiment. But after the PoC is done, spend some time to convert your
deployment to Infrastructure-as-Code. It can be Terraform, CDK, CloudFormation,
Pulumi or something else, the stack doesn&rsquo;t really matter. What matters is that
you have a reviewable, version controlled, and analysable snapshot of your
infrastructure configuration.</p>
<p>This enables a whole lot of capabilities from the start. You can have static
analysis tools that help you while writing IaC scripts (ex: <code>tfsec</code> for Terraform).
You can have your pipeline enforce infrastructure standards on the code itself
(<code>checkov</code> for Terraform and other tools). You can keep track of the changes
that get applied on your environments. And you can control how infrastructure
changes are applied from dev -&gt; test -&gt; to production.</p>
<p>Just having this capability to block credentials from being committed, enforce
TLS and encryption at rest, and I don&rsquo;t know, maybe block people from making
buckets and databases public, is a huge step towards making your application
secure.</p>
<h2 id="delivery">Delivery</h2>
<p>So you have your code, you have your cloud architecture, now lets get this code
deployed on the cloud.</p>
<p>This is where CI/CD comes in. I don&rsquo;t think my article needs to convince you to
use automated CI/CD pipelines. If it does, stop spending time on LinkedIn and
focus!!</p>
<p>Standards mean nothing if you aren&rsquo;t enforcing them. That means also on
yourself. Even if you&rsquo;re a single person startup working on a product, getting
a CI/CD setup up and running on Github only takes a couple of hours at most. An
automated CI/CD pipeline ensures that any software quality control, any build
time security (and other) optimisations, security scanning, signing, and
rolling out infrastructure changes is done precisely the same everytime a build
and a deploy is done. There&rsquo;s a lot of moving parts here, enough to make really
bad mistakes really easily if not automated. There is really no excuse for
manual deployment in 2025, hell, even back in 2015.</p>
<p>All of the steps I talked about earlier, static scanning, IaC policy
enforcement, dependency scanning, and code and package signing <del>can be</del>
should be automated using CI/CD pipelines. In fact, most of the third party
tools directly support Github Actions, so it&rsquo;s just a matter of a few minutes
to get all of this included in your pipeline.</p>
<p>When it comes to deployment, obviously, you shouldn&rsquo;t be storing long term access tokens in Github, so use
native features such as OIDC authentication for Github id-token to assign a
suitable deployment role to your Github managed runners. As an additional step,
you can have AWS based runners (EC2, ECS etc) registered in Github for a more
secure setup, but most web applications don&rsquo;t need this.</p>
<h2 id="operations">Operations</h2>
<p>Okay, now you have deployed your code in the cloud. What&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>Next you have to keep it running. You have to keep an eye on resource usage,
database performance, end user experience, and in general anything that smells
fishy when it comes to security.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t be able to do this effectively if you don&rsquo;t have a good enough view
into your environment. This is why, in the above infrastructure section, I
mentioned a suitable-sized Landing Zone. This would give you centralised
logging, an audit trail, a suitable starter point for continous compliance with
Config rules, and a compartmentalised account structure.</p>
<p>Based on these, you can build a useful basis for operational and business
alerts that you can respond to. AWS CloudWatch can help set all of this up,
including alert notifications.</p>
<p>For an example, you can have a Config rule that checks if all S3 buckets in
your AWS Organization have public access blocked. When that rule fails because
the owner of the company said &ldquo;just get it done&rdquo; when the developer told him
&ldquo;making the bucket public is a bad idea&rdquo;, the whole company would know a
security standard has been breached because there are alarms going off
everywhere you look. Standards are useless until you start enforcing them.</p>
<p>You should think about backup and restore, and you should think about
automating it. This means frequent backups to the RDS instances and S3 buckets.
It also means you&rsquo;re testing your capability to restore this backed up data if
the need comes. AWS Backup has all the features you&rsquo;d need to get this setup in
a pretty simple way.</p>
<p>In general, all web applications would benefit from having standard DDoS
protection on any cloud provider, however for some extended protection maybe
needed. GuardDuty and GuardDuty advanced protection features would be helpful
here. You can also have Web Application Firewall</p>
<p>secure access
audit trail
logging
backup, restore etc
cyber defense</p>
<h2 id="compliance">Compliance</h2>
