<p>So this article and the video is my congratulating myself for getting the
coveted AWS Golden Jacket.</p>
<p>Seriously though, it is a really good feeling to finally have the physical
jacket with me. Not that I can wear it during the coming spring and summer. To
be honest though, not that I&rsquo;ll be wearing this outside anyways. It&rsquo;s so shiny
that I&rsquo;ll get pulled over for blinding other drivers.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-10-13_1.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>The AWS Golden Jacket is awarded to recognise people who have passed all the
active AWS certifications at the time. There seems to be a confusion in the
community on what exactly the criteria are for this recognition. To be honest,
all I know is that it&rsquo;s on AWS to decide how the criteria is defined. As a
general rule, it seems to include completing all the active AWS certifications.</p>
<p>I have heard of a few other occassions where people have received golden
jackets through the AWS Ambassador programme or the AWS Heroes programme.
However I&rsquo;m not sure how those are awarded, and it seems almost all of those
have been awarded at AWS re:Invent conventions or the associated AWS Ambassador
Summits.</p>
<p>For me, I finished all of the exams as of mid-July this year (technically end
of June as I recertified two more exams just because I didn&rsquo;t want the
qualifications for my Golden Jacket to expire soon after getting it). It took
some time for the actual physical jacket to reach me, but AWS did hold a small
event at the partner organisation I&rsquo;m working at before that happened (because
of various unrelated reasons).</p>
<p>In fact, I did all the certifications (except for the Machine Learning
Specialty certification which was not expiring anytime soon) within 8 weeks.
I&rsquo;ll make a video and an article on my experience doing all those exams in a
short period soon.</p>
<p>It was not a fun feeling to be on exam mode for 8 straight weeks, sometimes
doing multiple exams within the same week, so getting something shiny like this
as a reward helps a lot.</p>
<p>There are only a handful of Golden Jacket holders in New Zealand at the moment,
but there are a few more in Australia as far as I know. Japan seems to be the
record holder for the most number of Golden Jacket receivers.</p>
<p>I think I was the 9th person to receive the Golden Jacket here in NZ, and I
with it I might be the first person in NZ to have both the AWS Golden Jacket
and the CNCF Kubestronaut Blue Jacket (yeah, I did all those exams for the
swag).</p>
<p>I work with a few other Golden Jacket holders, the first and a few within the
top 5 to receive in NZ are my colleagues at work. Trust me, the environment
helps, a lot!</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t received the CNCF Kubestronaut Blue Jacket yet, it&rsquo;s another logistic
issue that CNCF is working on. I&rsquo;m hopeful I&rsquo;ll be able to share some photos of
it here before the year ends.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in adding these to your wardrobe, keep a lookout on my
youtube channel for dedicated videos on how I did the AWS and CNCF exams to
qualify for the two programmes. I&rsquo;m hoping to release those in the next few
weeks.</p>
<p>Alright, I&rsquo;m going to now carefully store this where it&rsquo;ll never see the light of
day except for an AWS Summit, an AWS Community Day, or some other function
where I can comfortably wear it.</p>
