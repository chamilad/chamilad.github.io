      <description>I wrote a Prometheus Exporter that converts and exposes some metrics from Kibana API. This was mostly inspired by an already existing Exporter, that needs to be installed in Kibana as a Plugin. While that is a neat feature, managed ELK services like ElasticSearch Service by Elastic (commonly known as ElasticCloud) require another, more standalone approach.
kibana-exporter -kibana.uri http://localhost:5601 -kibana.username elastic -kibana.password password The Exporter is pretty basic one written in less than 500 lines of collective Go code.</description>

      <description>What should an Observability Framework address? In the previous post, we measured the temperature of the water on what Observability is and why it should be a first class consideration in system design. Let’s explore the possibility of a structured approach for designing observable systems.
Why should there be a structured approach? In short, because Observability has to be designed into a system rather than be considered as an on-the-spot hack.</description>

      <description>A introduction to the buzzword and the rationale for implementing it What is Observability? Before we dive in to the waters, we need to define what observability is. Let’s go for some tweets first.
Monitoring is for operating software/systems
Instrumentation is for writing software
Observability is for understanding systems

      <description>When it comes to deployment observability there are multiple, comprehensive solutions that can handle almost any system of scale you throw at them. I said almost, because there are certain stories that do not require setting up a central monitoring server with satellite agents to collect and enrich data.
For an example, consider a scenario where you’re troubleshooting a certain single process for a particular period of time. You want to collect the approximate CPU usage, approximate memory usage, light weight process (aka thread) count, and the TCP connection count.</description>
