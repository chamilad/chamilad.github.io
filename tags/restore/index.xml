      <description>So my last post on AWS Backup uses a lot of Terraform code that I had written even before the post. When doing a video on the subject, I realised that for a beginner, explaining something like AWS Backup with Terraform presents two fronts to understand at the same time.
So I&amp;rsquo;m following up with another video and a blog post that does the same demo but only using the AWS Web Console.</description>

      <description>Mount Kaukau    Continuing from the previous article on introduction to AWS Backup
 Offsite Backups Let&amp;rsquo;s talk theory for a bit.

      <description>What else is better than a photo of water being backed up - Birchville Dam   AWS Backup AWS Backup is a service introduced a few years ago to centrally manage backup options for various AWS services that deal with data persistence. These include RDS, DynamoDB, EBS, EFS, EC2, S3, and Amazon FSx. What was earlier at best by processes and architecture reviews and audits in different services with different strategies can be consolidated into a single service with a single Console.</description>
