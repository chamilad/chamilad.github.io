      <description>In the last article, I covered in brief, the solutions for the problem of authenticating into AWS from K8s workloads. This is the first detailed article (and the video) I promised I&amp;rsquo;ll follow up that with, going into to details on EKS Pod Identities. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to make this the most detailed, most in-depth video on the topic, but this article would probably have less details, so I highly recommend watching the video.</description>

      <description>This is an introductory post on the problem of authenticating into AWS from K8s workloads, either from within AWS or from outside of it. I&amp;rsquo;m going to discuss three major approaches to this problem and compare them against each other. I&amp;rsquo;ll follow this up with more detailed articles (and videos) on each approach, where I&amp;rsquo;ll go into details as much as possible.
Problem Statement The key problem I&amp;rsquo;m trying to tackle here is how to authenticate into AWS from workloads running in K8s.</description>

      <description>Point Sur, Cali 01    I just completed a mini article series on details of deploying an ELK stack on K8s. Following are the links to the series.
  ElasticSearch on K8s: 01 — Basic Design ElasticSearch on K8s: 02 — Log Collection with Filebeat ElasticSearch on K8s: 03 - Log Enrichment with Logstash ElasticSearch on K8s: 04 - Log Storage and Search with ElasticSearch ElasticSearch on K8s: 05 - Visualization and Production Readying ElasticSearch Index Management Authentication and Authorization for ElasticSearch: 01 - A Blueprint for Multi-tenant SSO Authentication and Authorization for ElasticSearch: 02 - Basic SSO with Role Assignment Authentication and Authorization for ElasticSearch: 03 - Multi-Tenancy with KeyCloak and Kibana  So far, the articles have been discussing points related to functional requirements of a Log Aggregation stack deployed on K8s.</description>
