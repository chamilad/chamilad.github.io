      <description>Point Dorset, Wellington   Malware protection in compute workloads in AWS is a topic that I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking into recently. After working with security auditors for a few weeks (adding up a few months now), I was essentially forced to evaluate all the possible scenarios for malware protection in AWS for typical workloads.
Typical Malware Protection Requirements The following key features can be identified as typical malware protection requirements for most solutions.</description>

      <description>Mount Kaukau    Continuing from the previous article on introduction to AWS Backup
 Offsite Backups Let&amp;rsquo;s talk theory for a bit.
Data protection in a given solution depends on how thoughtful the backup strategy is. While a simple Backup Plan in AWS Backup that periodically takes a backup of the database into the Account-local Vault could technically be considered as a backup strategy, it is not a good one.</description>

      <description>What else is better than a photo of water being backed up - Birchville Dam   AWS Backup AWS Backup is a service introduced a few years ago to centrally manage backup options for various AWS services that deal with data persistence. These include RDS, DynamoDB, EBS, EFS, EC2, S3, and Amazon FSx. What was earlier at best by processes and architecture reviews and audits in different services with different strategies can be consolidated into a single service with a single Console.</description>

      <description>Again, the only photo with me for now that&amp;#39;s closest to the theme, a spider weaving a trap near Manigala, Sri Lanka   Secrets Manager secret types AWS Secret Manager supports a several types of secrets. These are mainly to support effective secret management by integrating them closer with the AWS Services they support. These are mainly various types of database services offered by AWS, which is one of the key uses for using Secrets Manager to manage master credentials.</description>

      <title>Server Immutability</title>

      <description>Server Immutability is an interesting concept that I managed to come across when I first started playing around with Containers. Interestingly, it’s often used in conjunction with Containerization because of the use of startup file systems (or Images). However Server Immutability is something that goes beyond simple Docker images.
What is Immutability? Immutability, when it comes to server instances, is not changing a once deployed instance. Any change that should be done, has to be done in a new version of the instance image and the old running instances should be replaced with the instances spawned from the new image.</description>

      <description>Or the SSL Cert Extension that saves your back during development
 I recently wrote an article on how to generate and upload a self-signed SSL Certificate to AWS Certificate Manager. One of the cases I had missed to address there was the inconsistency of the Load Balancer and development domain names during the early phases of any project. This is a practical issue, fortunately that an extension in the SSL Certificate standard addresses.</description>

      <title>Adding a Self-Signed SSL Certificate to AWS ACM</title>

      <description>When setting up AWS Load Balancers (Classic Load Balancers or Application Load Balancers), after adding a HTTPS transport, an SSL Certificate should be added so that SSL termination can be done at the Load Balancer. Here, for development purposes, the certificate added can be a self-signed one.
However if you try to upload a self-signed SSL Certificate to IAM or ACM using the AWS Web Console during Load Balancer creation, you will frequently come across an error similar to the following.</description>

      <title>Infrastructure as Code : AWS CloudFormation</title>

      <description>This blog post is based on a talk I did on AWS CloudFormation as an introduction.
  The case for Infrastructure as Code Imagine a typical deployment of a software stack. The process might look like the following.
 Design solution architecture Estimate infrastructure specs Configure compute, network, and database resources manually Deploy the applications and prepare databases Test and ship  Pretty simple from the looks of it doesn’t it?</description>
