      <description>This article is on one of the new features AWS released recently, called Resource Control Policies (RCPs).
RCPs are a new way to enforce policies on data (resources) rather than principals in AWS. For principals, the way to enforce policies is to use Service Control Policies (SCPs), which if you&amp;rsquo;re already familiar with AWS would know plenty about. However, RCPs can still be a little confusing.
What are RCPs?</description>

      <description>AWS Account IDs are interesting. They are not directly considered as sensitive, but on the other hand everyone seems to consider them as sensitive.
It&amp;rsquo;s probably for good reason. You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t give out anything that isn&amp;rsquo;t needed to get work done, even if those data are not &amp;ldquo;sensitive&amp;rdquo; in particular. Your name isn&amp;rsquo;t sensitive in particular, but you don&amp;rsquo;t usually walk around with your name on your tshirt either.</description>
