      <description>Intro   I covered establishing a comprehensive cross-account backup strategy in AWS Organizations in the previous articles and videos.
However, as an architect, one of the most frequent patterns I come across in the real world in this space is organisations having an imbalance of backup and recovery strategies. This is when there is a really detailed backup process that includes all the production resources in the backup jobs, with encrypted and replicated copies, but having minimum or even zero effort in testing recoverability of the backed up data and having playbooks for such scenarios.</description>

      <description>So my last post on AWS Backup uses a lot of Terraform code that I had written even before the post. When doing a video on the subject, I realised that for a beginner, explaining something like AWS Backup with Terraform presents two fronts to understand at the same time.
So I&amp;rsquo;m following up with another video and a blog post that does the same demo but only using the AWS Web Console.</description>

      <description>Mount Kaukau    Continuing from the previous article on introduction to AWS Backup
 Offsite Backups Let&amp;rsquo;s talk theory for a bit.
Data protection in a given solution depends on how thoughtful the backup strategy is. While a simple Backup Plan in AWS Backup that periodically takes a backup of the database into the Account-local Vault could technically be considered as a backup strategy, it is not a good one.</description>

      <description>What else is better than a photo of water being backed up - Birchville Dam   AWS Backup AWS Backup is a service introduced a few years ago to centrally manage backup options for various AWS services that deal with data persistence. These include RDS, DynamoDB, EBS, EFS, EC2, S3, and Amazon FSx. What was earlier at best by processes and architecture reviews and audits in different services with different strategies can be consolidated into a single service with a single Console.</description>
