      <description>This is part of a series of short articles on setting up an ELK deployment on K8s.
  ElasticSearch on K8s: 01 — Basic Design ElasticSearch on K8s: 02 — Log Collection with Filebeat  Log Collection The typical task for a log collection tool is to collect a specified set of logs, from a specified set of locations, and offload them to a specified endpoint. Let’s explore these three aspects in detail.</description>

      <description>A design for a useful ELK deployment on K8s Log aggregation in a K8s environment is something I have lightly touched upon previously in multiple occasions. However setting up a minimal but a reliable log aggregation stack on top of K8s could quickly become an evolutionary process with each step improving on the previous one (and of course, everyone thinks they can do log aggregation before they actually start to do so).</description>

      <description>I’ve recently been doing some work involving analytics dashboards and the subject proved to be really interesting. It has a wide range starting from Big Data to UX. Starting at a point where you determine what kind of data is collected and what kind information you need to get out of the dashboard, going to data analysis and data processing (probably on top an engine like Apache Spark), it finalizes at the visualization stage which is really fun.</description>
