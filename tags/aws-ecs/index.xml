      <description>Or how to publish to Splunk from any Docker environment WSO2 products follow a standard structure when it comes to configuration, data, artifacts, and logging. Configuration files are found in /repository/conf folder, data in /repository/data, artifacts in /repository/deployment (or in /repository/tenants folder if you’re in to multi-tenancy). All the log files are written into /repository/logs folder.
Log Aggregation All log events are output as entries to files through Log4J. Because of this, when it’s time to attach WSO2 logging to a log aggregator, it’s a matter of incorporating a tailing file reader agent and directing it towards /repository/logs folder.</description>
