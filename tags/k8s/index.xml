      <description>Point Sur, Cali 01
 I just completed a mini article series on details of deploying an ELK stack on K8s. Following are the links to the series.
  ElasticSearch on K8s: 01 — Basic Design ElasticSearch on K8s: 02 — Log Collection with Filebeat ElasticSearch on K8s: 03 - Log Enrichment with Logstash ElasticSearch on K8s: 04 - Log Storage and Search with ElasticSearch ElasticSearch on K8s: 05 - Visualization and Production Readying  So far, the articles have been discussing points related to functional requirements of a Log Aggregation stack deployed on K8s.</description>

      <description>The comms tower on top of Riverston, Sri Lanka
As the series on ElasticSearch deployment management in K8s is complete, I thought of writing down some of the Index Management tasks that I had to implement in order to reduce the manual work involved in cluster maintenance.
 Following is the series of posts on ElasticSearch on K8s.
  ElasticSearch on K8s: 01 — Basic Design ElasticSearch on K8s: 02 — Log Collection with Filebeat ElasticSearch on K8s: 03 - Log Enrichment with Logstash ElasticSearch on K8s: 04 - Log Storage and Search with ElasticSearch ElasticSearch on K8s: 05 - Visualization and Production Readying  The following management steps are not mandatory to be implemented in a cluster to be production ready, however having them in place would greatly reduce some of the common headaches involved in an ELK stack management.</description>

      <description>A design for a useful ELK deployment on K8s Log aggregation in a K8s environment is something I have lightly touched upon previously in multiple occasions. However setting up a minimal but a reliable log aggregation stack on top of K8s could quickly become an evolutionary process with each step improving on the previous one (and of course, everyone thinks they can do log aggregation before they actually start to do so).</description>

      <description>What should be your concerns for WSO2 on Docker? Deploying WSO2 products on Containerized platforms is a well-tested well-resourced activity. There are various resources available to deploy WSO2 products on Docker, Kubernetes, CloudFoundry, AWS ECS, and Apache Mesos, both officially and unofficially. However, designing a Docker image so that optimal non-functional traits like performance, operational efficiency, and security is a separate topic in itself.
Options available to obtain WSO2 products other than downloading the Zip file itself (https://wso2.</description>
